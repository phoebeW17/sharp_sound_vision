# Sharp Sound & Vision

![ responsive screenshot]

## Introduction

Sharp Sound & Vision (SS&V) is a web application which displays a portfolio of videography projects to attract clients and collaborators. The concept came about when speaking to a friend who wants to start up a film-making business. Existing platforms like social media and traditional portfolios often lack the cohesive and professional presentation needed to stand out in a competitive market. Therefore the site provides my friend with the ability to showcase her work and the feedback she has recieved from fellow collaborators or clients. 

SS&V has been developed as part of the Code Institute's 16 week Full-Stack Developer course as my final individual project - focusing on Django and Bootstrap frameworks, Database manipulation and CRUD functionality.

# UX - User Experience

## Design Inspiration

My friend came up with the name Sharp Sound & Vision for her business and as soon as she told me, I had visions of a clean and slick site which has a professional yet unique feel.

I chose to make a mood-board via Pinterest so I could gather inspiration and visuals. Please find the link here: [Pinterest Board](https://pin.it/3HVshY5Uh)


### Colour Scheme

Driven by the inspiration gathered on Pinterest, I found that a neutral set of colours would work best to achieve both a classy and accessible look to the site. In the explore section of [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/search?q=Neutral%20palette&t=term) I found the Palette of Persia. I also tested these with the Adobe Color Contrast Checker.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I chose to follow the MoSCoW Prioritization method for SS&V, identifying and labelling my:

- **Must Haves**: the 'required', critical components of the project. Completing my 'Must Haves' helped me to reach the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project early, allowing me to develop the project further than originally planned.
  
- **Should Haves**: the components that are valuable to the project but not absolutely 'vital' at the MVP stage. The 'Must Haves' must receive priority over the 'Should Haves'.
- **Could Haves**: these are the features that are a 'bonus' to the project, it would be nice to have them in this phase, but only if the most important issues have been completed first and time allows.

## User Stories

User stories and features recorded and managed via a project board on [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/phoebeW17/projects/6)

| User Story | Priority |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| As a **Site User** I would like to **register an account** so that I can **create on a post.** | **MUST HAVE** |
| As a **potential client**, I want to **read testimonials from previous clients** so that I can **gauge the videographer's reliability and professionalism.** | **MUST HAVE** |
| As the **site administrator**, I want to **update the pages on the site**  so that I can **promote and organise my work.** | **MUST HAVE** |
| As a **site user** I want to **navigate the site to find what section I want to access and explore** so that I can **find out more about the site.** | **MUST HAVE** |
| As a **potential client**, I want to **see the services Sharp S&V offers**, so that I can **see what is most appropriate for my project.** | **SHOULD HAVE** |
| As a **returning client**, I want to **see updates and new projects on the website** so that I can **stay informed about the videographerâ€™s recent work.** | **SHOULD HAVE** |
| As a **potential client**, I want to **see an about page**, so that I can **know more about the videographer's professional background and approach to projects.**  | **COULD HAVE** |

### Wireframes

The wireframes for SS&V were created in Balsamiq. It is useful to quickly create wireframes with it's collection of templates for different devices and viewpoints. It was important to think of how I wanted the site to be viewed on tablets and desktops as well as mobiles so Balsamiq was a good tool to use.

## AI Usage

#### Tools used: 

I used Microsoft CoPilot in the browser as well as the chat function and pair programmer in VS Code.

#### Example Uses:

 - Use AI tools to assist in
code creation

 - Use AI tools to assist in
debugging code

  </details>



- Use AI tools to optimize
code for performance and user
experience

- Use AI tools to create
automated unit tests

#### Reflection on AI Tools: 

I found the browser version of CoPilot to be useful as it was unobtrusive towards my code project but did have the drawback of not being able to view the sections of code I am working on. However, for the purpose of trouble-shooting I found this most useful.

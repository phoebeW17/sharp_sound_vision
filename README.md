# Sharp Sound & Vision

![ responsive screenshot]

## Introduction

Sharp Sound & Vision (SS&V) is a web application which displays a portfolio of videography projects to attract clients and collaborators. The concept came about when speaking to a friend who wants to start up a film-making business. Existing platforms like social media and traditional portfolios often lack the cohesive and professional presentation needed to stand out in a competitive market. Therefore the site provides my friend with the ability to showcase her work and the feedback she has recieved from fellow collaborators or clients. 

SS&V has been developed as part of the Code Institute's 16 week Full-Stack Developer course as my final individual project - focusing on Django and Bootstrap frameworks, Database manipulation and CRUD functionality.

# UX - User Experience

## Design Inspiration

My friend came up with the name Sharp Sound & Vision for her business and as soon as she told me, I had visions of a clean and slick site which has a professional yet unique feel.

I chose to make a mood-board via Pinterest so I could gather inspiration and visuals. Please find the link here: [Pinterest Board](https://pin.it/3HVshY5Uh)


### Colour Scheme

Driven by the inspiration gathered on Pinterest, I found that a neutral set of colours would work best to achieve both a classy and accessible look to the site. In the explore section of [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/search?q=Neutral%20palette&t=term) I found the Palette of Persia. I also tested these with the Adobe Color Contrast Checker.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I chose to follow the MoSCoW Prioritization method for SS&V, identifying and labelling my:

- **Must Haves**: the 'required', critical components of the project. Completing my 'Must Haves' helped me to reach the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project early, allowing me to develop the project further than originally planned.
  
- **Should Haves**: the components that are valuable to the project but not absolutely 'vital' at the MVP stage. The 'Must Haves' must receive priority over the 'Should Haves'.
- **Could Haves**: these are the features that are a 'bonus' to the project, it would be nice to have them in this phase, but only if the most important issues have been completed first and time allows.

## User Stories

User stories and features recorded and managed via a project board on [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/phoebeW17/projects/6)
